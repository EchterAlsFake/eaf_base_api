# EAF Base API

! Still in Development

This Python package is a base api for all my Porn Site APIs. A lot of sites use the same methods, and
there's a lot of code that I've rewritten again and again. This is why I created this base api, so that 
I need to write less code and everything is easier to be maintainable. 

# PRs
Pull Requests are welcome, but if you make changes run `pytest` on all APIs that are using this to make sure your
PR didn't break anything.

# Documentation

As this is some kind of 'raw' base API, this won't be documented, as it's only functional when used together
with the main APIs. 

Maybe you can look at the code comments. They could be helpful

# Implementation
You are welcome to implement this API in your own projects. If it's useful... But I don't recommend this, as things
might change without a warning. But things like the threaded downloads can be useful for other projects :) 

I'd say the threaded modes from the download module are already very well optimized, so feel free to just copy them
for your own projects. You don't need to do any attribution, I don't care :)
